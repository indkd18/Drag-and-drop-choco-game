Hi im trying to make a little 2D educational minigame in Unity.
Below is how i wanted the game to be basically. Its a minigame so yes its supposed to be short. 
I am a beginner so im not very well versed with all this and used GPT for help, unfortunately.. theres only so much it can do before absolutely butchering the game and my sanity.

The whole thing is done with UI elements in the canvas and i have tried to do this using just 2d objects and that was also bad.

The spawning has gone nuts and doesnt look like how i intended but i was gonna put that aside until i got the actual gameplay to work. 
If anyone has notes on what to remember when setting up the prefabs/UI/tags etc. do let me know in case i overlooked anything.

This is what my game end up looking like ....

As you can see it looks badddd. 

Edit: I managed to fix one of the issues and ill keep updating incase something else goes wrong or if anyone has notes on how to make it better :3
